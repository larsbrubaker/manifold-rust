# Deliberate divergences from the C++ reference

Per CLAUDE.md, byte-matching `cpp-reference/manifold` is the default; the
entries below are the deliberate exceptions — each one an accuracy fix or a
measured improvement, with the evidence that justified it. Trace-diff
debugging against the C++ must expect these.

## 1. Robust-engine outputs skip `swap_degenerates` (2026-08-08)

**What differs:** meshes assembled by the robust boolean engine
(`src/robust/assemble.rs`) do not run `edge_op::swap_degenerates` during
their import/simplification. The exact engine's pipeline is unchanged and
still byte-matches C++ (`Impl::SimplifyTopology`).

**Where:** `Manifold::from_mesh_gl64_robust_assembled`
(`src/manifold_meshgl.rs`, `pub(crate)`, used only by `robust::assemble`)
runs `cleanup_topology` + `collapse_short_edges` + `calculate_vert_normals`
in place of `edge_op::remove_degenerates`, and `assemble` composes the same
pieces plus `collapse_colinear_edges` in place of `simplify_topology`.
`edge_op`'s own functions are untouched; only the composition differs. Every
other import path, including user meshes arriving through
`from_mesh_gl_robust` / `from_mesh_gl64_robust`, is byte-identical to before.

**Why:** `face_op::set_normals_and_coplanar` (faithful port of C++
`Impl::SetNormalsAndCoplanar`, impl.cpp:214) flood-fills a seed triangle's
normal onto every coplanar neighbor with no orientation check. A boolean
result legitimately contains coplanar *antiparallel* adjacencies (material
below the plane on one side of a shared edge, above it on the other), so a
handful of large triangles receive sign-flipped normals. `swap_degenerates`
then misclassifies them as degenerate (`ccw <= 0`) and swaps large
non-planar quads — physically moving the surface. On Thingi10K #301921 ∪
rotated-self this moved the robust union volume by −2.5e-3 (and the exact
engine's own result by +5.6e-5; both engines' outputs are exposed, exact
merely got tessellation-lucky). Skipping the swap keeps robust volumes
extraction-exact. The cost is slightly larger tri/vert-count drift versus
the exact engine, which the sweep gate already treats as advisory.

**Evidence:** `robust::thingi_tests::thingi_301921_union_rotated_self_matches_exact`,
the staged volume traces in the session log (extraction 0.438010 preserved
through cleanup, lost only in swap), and the Monte-Carlo referee
(`examples/volume_referee.rs`).
