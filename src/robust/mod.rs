// robust/mod.rs — Robust boolean engine for general (possibly non-manifold)
// closed, orientable triangle meshes.
//
// Implements Barki, Guennebaud, Foufou 2015, "Exact, robust, and efficient
// regularized Booleans on general 3D meshes" (docs/Exact, robust, and
// efficient booleans.pdf). This engine is a parallel alternative to the
// ported exact pipeline in src/boolean3.rs: it requires inputs only to be
// geometrically closed and orientable (triangle soup is fine — connectivity
// is never trusted), at the cost of exact rational arithmetic on the hard
// predicate/construction cases.
//
// Selection between the two engines is via `types::BooleanEngine`
// (Exact | Robust | Auto); the exact engine remains the default and its
// behavior is byte-identical to before this module existed.
//
// Submodules (pipeline order):
//   exact              — rational points, filtered predicates, constructions
//   tri_tri            — exact triangle-triangle intersection (narrow phase)
//   arrangement        — per-triangle 2D arrangement of intersection prims
//   cdt                — exact constrained Delaunay triangulation
//   intersection_graph — broad phase, prim distribution, piece emission
//   classify           — radial rings, Prop 2/3 union/intersection tagging
//   propagate          — per-mesh tag flood fill between intersection cuts
//   ray_shoot          — exact winding numbers for untouched components
